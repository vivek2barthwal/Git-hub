# Automatic data visualisation for large datasets.

The Autoviz class can visualise a maximum of 15000 rows and 30 columns. Thus, it can group the row-data based on the number of features available in column-data. 

This is a tool to visualise data without hardcoding it. It provides you with scatter plots, heatmaps and all kinds of infographic charts. The charts are decided based on the data.

Useful for large datasets where the parameters to be compared are not apparent to the user.
